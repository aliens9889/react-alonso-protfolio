# Alonso Parra's Website

This project I will show the skills that I have on **React.js**. This will be my website where the people will know that I'm looking for new opportunities!

And this website will show the projects that I built and everbody can check the projects and their repositories. I will use this repo to update the website and also to uploading new projects on it.

This website is inspired on the **Angel Pascual's website**. He is a Software developer like me and I liked very much the idea he took to built his website base on Star Wars. He also is looking for new opportunites, so please check his website and bring to him an opportunity. **Check his website [here](https://angelhpascual.com/)**

The concept I picked for my website was Avatar the legend of aang. You can check this repo if you want to get inspired to build your own website.

I will share the link of my website here too. **And as I promised here it is, check my website [here](https://alonsogchparra.web.app/)**
